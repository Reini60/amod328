This is a version of MikeB's 9xVoice board for the 9x, copied from images of
his Eagle designs posted on 9xforums. MikeB obviously knows what he's doing, 
as this is an amazing layout! It uses no SMD components, so should be easy to 
build for most of us mere mortals.

Eagle CAD Version: 6.3.0

Disclaimer: 

Although I confirmed that a printed version of the PCB fits perfectly in both 
my 9x transmitters, I have not actually etched & built this design. Feel free 
to modify the design, but please let me know if you find any errors!

Notes:

The board is double sided and uses thru holes, so it may not be the best for 
home etching. I use a PCB batching service, oshpark.com (no affilliation) to
manufacture all my boards. It's as simple as uploading the Eagle .brd file,
wait 2 weeks or so and you get your boards. The only gotcha is that you need 
to order a minimum of 3 boards, so it may make sense to do a group order.

Thanks!
